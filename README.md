# Water Availability

### Description
This repository contains the model that uses a combination of climate change coefficients to develop a projections of water availability in Columbia River Basin. 
The model allows to select one of many flow control points across Columbia Rover Basin and obtain the information about the projected average streamflow for every month in the user-selected time period in future.
The program also provides a comparison of the current and future average values for every month. It also shows the month during which the peak flow occurs. This information is important for the entities who perform water planning and management activities.
